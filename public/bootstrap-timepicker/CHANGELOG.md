## Unreleased

## 0.5.1 - 2015-08-06
### Changed
- Critical fix (#279) for bootstrap initialization. If you happened to
  list your timepicker's classes in an order other than "input-group
  bootstrap-timepicker", you'd be out of luck. Now we use jQuery's
  `hasClass` method correctly. Yay!

## 0.5 - 2015-07-31
### Changed
- Bootstrap 3 support. No more Bootstrap 2 support.
- setTime sets time better
- more tests, and they exercise Bootstrap 3 support!
- snapToStep is a new option, off by default, which snaps times to the
  nearest step or overflows to 0 if it would otherwise snap to 60 or
  more.
- explicitMode is a new option, off by default, which lets you leave
  out colons when typing times.
- shift+tab now correctly moves the cursor to the previously
  highlighted unit, and blurs the timepicker when expected.
- We have cut out significant amounts of old cruft from the
  repository.
- Minified/Uglified code is no longer kept in the repo. Please
  download a release tarball or zip file to get the compiled and
  minified CSS and Javascript files.
